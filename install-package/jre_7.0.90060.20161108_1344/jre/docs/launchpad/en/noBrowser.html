  <br>
  Accessing the documentation without the launchpad<br>
  =================================================<br>
  <br>
  You can access the documentation without a browser by looking in the docs
  directory of the sdk. The documentation files are held in the content
  directory.<br>
  <br>
  API documentation is held in the apidocs directory. Other documentation
  is held in language-specific directories.  If a document does not exist
  for your language, use the English version in the en directory.<br>
  <br>

  =====================================================================<br>
  <br>
  The launchpad supports the following browsers:<br>
  o Mozilla<br>
  o Firefox<br>
  o Internet Explorer (Microsoft Windows platforms only)<br>
  <br>
  Use the following procedure to attempt to correct the error that is
  preventing the launchpad from displaying and to try to restart the
  launchpad:<br>
  <br>
  1. If you do not have the Mozilla Web browser, download and install the Mozilla Web browser from http://www.mozilla.org.<br>
