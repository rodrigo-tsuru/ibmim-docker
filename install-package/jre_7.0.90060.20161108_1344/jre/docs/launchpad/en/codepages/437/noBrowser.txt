An error occurred while starting the launchpad.  This error typically
occurs when the launchpad is unable to find a supported browser.

Accessing the documentation without the launchpad
=================================================

You can access the documentation without a browser by looking in the docs
directory of the sdk. The documentation files are held in the content
directory.

API documentation is held in the apidocs directory. Other documentation
is held in language-specific directories.  If a document does not exist
for your language, use the English version in the en directory.

Correcting the error that is preventing the launchpad from displaying
=====================================================================

The launchpad supports the following browsers:
   o   Mozilla
   o   Firefox
   o   Internet Explorer (Microsoft Windows platforms only)

Use the following procedure to attempt to correct the error that is
preventing the launchpad from displaying and to try to restart the
launchpad:

1. If you do not have the Mozilla Web browser, download and install the
   Mozilla Web browser from http://www.mozilla.org. 

    On Linux and UNIX platforms, export the location of the supported
    browser. For example:   

    export BROWSER=/usr/bin/mozilla

2. Restart the launchpad by issuing the following command in the docs
   directory: 

	Linux and UNIX platforms:      ./launchpad.sh
	Windows platforms:             launchpad.exe
